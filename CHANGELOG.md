# version 0.4.6 (2023-10-17)

- First "tagged" release, this "first" version number was set to the same version number that Utopia-CMS will release today, we will use this convention to know better the compatibility of both systems (api calls, custom sync scripts, etc).
- The most important change in this commit is the settings improvements, removing unnecessary settings, adding others that are used in code without specifing a default value, and updating samples files accordingly.
