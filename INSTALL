Utopia Customer Relationship Management Installation

Documentation about installing Utopia's CRM.

===============
Code repository
===============

Obtain the code from GitHub with:

``git clone git@github.com:utopia/utopia-crm.git``

and change to that folder

``cd utopia-crm``

=========================================================
Create a virtual environment and install CRM dependencies
=========================================================

virtualenv is a tool to create an isolated Python enviroment, refer to: https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/ for installation.

This project uses Python 2.7 so a virtualenv virtual enviroment should be created with that version of Python:

``virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 virtualenv_name``

Note that you should have Python 2.7 already installed. In the preceding example the binary was in the /usr/bin/python2.7 route.
This last command will create a folder virtualenv_name where all Django and Python dependencies should
be installed.

Activate the virtual enviroment:
`source virtualenv_name/bin/activate`

And then install all needed dependencies using the requirements.txt file using pip.

`(virtualenv_name) user@user-machine:~/projects/utopia-crm$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

This will install all required dependencies in the virtualenv_name enviroment.

## Install requirements

``pip install -r requirements.txt``


## Postgres database setup

In this example a PostgreSQL database is used, the following is a posible set up.

First create the database and role (Ubuntu):
~~~~
sudo -i
su postgres
psql
~~~~

You should be logged in as postgres with the command prompt:
`postgres=#`

And create a development database owned by utopiadev_owners:
Also, create the extension POSTGIS on this database. Make sure postgis is installed on your server.
~~~~
CREATE DATABASE utopiadev;
\c utopiadev
CREATE ROLE utopiadev_owners;
ALTER DATABASE utopiadev OWNER TO utopiadev_owners;
ALTER SCHEMA public OWNER TO utopiadev_owners;
CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
~~~~

Then create a user named utopiadev_django that Django will use in the migration to create CRM tables. The user should be created logged in as postgres user in your linux box:
`postgres@user-machine:/root$ createuser --interactive --pwprompt`
~~~~
Enter name of role to add: utopiadev_django
Enter password for new role:
Enter it again:
Shall the new role be a superuser? (y/n) n
Shall the new role be allowed to create databases? (y/n) n
Shall the new role be allowed to create more new roles? (y/n) n
Password:
~~~~

## Project configuration

In utopia-crm folder copy local_settings_sample.py to local_settings.py and configure the database by modifiying DATABASE variable. Write user and password for the utopiadev_django user recently created:
The following example assumes the utopiadev_django password is utopiadev_django:

~~~~
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.contrib.gis.db.backends.postgis',
        'NAME': 'utopiadev', 'USER': 'utopiadev_django', 'PASSWORD': 'utopiadev_django',
    }
}
~~~~

# Project setup

Important note: Due to an error in django's libgeos module, a change needs to be made to one of the files before migrating the database.

The following file (replace virtualenv_name with the route to your virtualenv)

`virtualenv_name/lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/contrib/gis/geos/libgeos.py`

On the last function `geos_version_info` replace this:

`ver = geos_version().decode()`

with this

`ver = geos_version().decode().strip()`

After this was sorted out, use ``manage.py`` to run migrate and create all tables:
`(virtualenv_name) user@user-machine:~/projects/utopia-crm$ python manage.py migrate`

An output like this will appear:
~~~~
Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: admin, admin_honeypot, auth, authtoken, community, contenttypes, core, invoicing, logistics, sessions, support, taggit
Running migrations:
  Applying contenttypes.0001_initial... OK
  Applying auth.0001_initial... OK
  Applying admin.0001_initial... OK
  Applying admin.0002_logentry_remove_auto_add... OK
  Applying admin_honeypot.0001_initial... OK
...
~~~~

and all tables should be created without any problem.


# Create a superuser to login into the application

Run the following command:

``
(virtualenv_name) user@user-machine:~/projects/utopia-crm$ python manage.py createsuperuser
``

And follow the prompts to create your super user.

WARNING: This user has ALL permissions on the application database. It is recommended that you only give superuser permissions to people you trust. It can be deleted if it's not necessary.

# Create the default groups and populate them with their permissions.

Run the following command, which will create the default groups for the application with some basic permissions.

``
(virtualenv_name) user@user-machine:~/projects/utopia-crm$ python manage.py loaddata fixtures/default_groups.json
``

# Running the application

Start the server by running:

``
(virtualenv_name) user@user-machine:~/projects/utopia-crm$ python manage.py runserver
``

and go to the following URL in your browser:

``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
``
